# DA 225o Deep Learning (Summer 2025)

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to **Deep Learning**, with a strong emphasis on contemporary applications in **Generative AI (GenAI)**. It blends foundational machine learning theory with practical implementation, preparing students to build, train, and deploy advanced deep learning models for natural language, vision, audio, and multi-modal data.

Students will explore core concepts such as neural network architectures, transformer models, and data preprocessing, followed by hands-on training in fine-tuning large models, orchestrating AI agents, and managing production-ready AI systems.

> **Note:** The GitHub repository for the course contains all tutorial notebooks, reference code, and implementation material.
